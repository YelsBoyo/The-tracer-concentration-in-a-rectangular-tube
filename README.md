MATLAB script file that simulates the time variation of concentration at downstream sections of 60 km and 110 km using different numerical methods (Upwind, Lax-Wendroff, and QUICK) 
These Matlab scripts address 1D advection-dispersion issues: 10kg of tracer is put into one portion of a straight, rectangular tube that is fully mixed. H=0.4m, B=10m,S0=0.0004. Sand is used for the channel bed. With numerical methods (UW, LW, QUICKEST) or other methods using Matlab and using mesh to visualize, can you simulate the time variation of concentration at downstream sections of 60 km and 110 km, respectively?
